Title: Individuals and the Environment
Hours worked: ~6 hours

This is the third project I made for the Girls Who Code Pathways program in the web development track! This project was supposed to be an activist website, so I made a website about Climate Change, 
an issue that I feel strongly about.
I made this project using HTML, CSS, and javascript.

What I struggled with: I struggled with adding formatting my header and header image.
What I learned: I learned how to add a button that would show different text when clicked.

This project doesn't have any commits because I made it in replit so I couldn't commit while making the project.
