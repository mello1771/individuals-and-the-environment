        <p>When many people hear how climate change must be stopped, they think: "How can I do anything? I'm just one person!"
        And while that is a valid concern, there are many things that just one person can do to decrease their personal greenhouse gas emissions. If everyone changed a few of their habits, then emissions would decrease significantly.</p>
