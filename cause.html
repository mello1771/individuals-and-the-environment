      <h1>Climate Change - What is it?</h1>
      <p>The rising in temperatures and change in weather patterns is referred to as Climate Change or Global Warming. This is caused by an excess of greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The source of this excess is things that humans do, such as burning fossil fuels. This is an issue created by humanity, and it must be fixed by it as well.</p>

      <h1>The Effects</h1>
      <p>Climate change can and does affect many parts of people's everyday lives, such as health, how we grow food, safety, and housing. Global warming causes an increase in natural disasters, like hurricanes and droughts, which puts many people's lives in jeopordy. The planet can not survive in an increasingly warmed environment, so it is essential for us to take action.</p>
